## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1,

Obviously this was my favorite Lab because of the simplicity of the code we used to make (Hello world), however what also makes this one of my favorites was my partner Haroon. We both helped each other with setting up the github together and figuring out the assignment in the long run. After the lab we still talked to this day conversing through messagings to help each other with ongoing labs or lectures in our class becoming closer friends.

Lab 2,

Another fun lab because of the flow of the assignment and how I taught and led my group. The assignment wanted us to use print statements using "std::" and "cout", wasn't hard to understand but my group was only struggling on a single mistake they caused so I was impressed with myself figuring out how the code gave errors and helped them push the code to git. The group was also a fun group with great communications and easy code that led this lab to be my second favorite.

Lab 11 Part-2,

One of my few labs that I was completely unsure of how to finish, especially for part-1, however Part-2 was my 3rd favorite lab because of the game rng code. Back in high school a few of my friends and I worked to create a fighting game and we used similar code to get a functioning rng built into the game. Even though it was mostly tedious finding the right code this lab was still one of my favorites because of the memories it brought back even somewhat helping as I went back to the game to remember some code to use.
